Because of this — and because layer cakes may be as close as some will ever get to a holy experience — they’re often called church cakes. This chocolate one is a perfectly moist and stacked rendition of a pudding cake, with just the right amount of richness from the frosting. This formula needs no alterations, but there’s no sense in breaking the tradition of Southern bakers, who personalize recipes as a point of pride. Add pulverized praline to the center, or cinnamon or instant-coffee granules to the batter. Don’t be afraid to make it your own. To make it a true church cake, serve it to those you hold in the highest regard, for celebrations or to simply indulge in the good glory of company.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lisa Donovan"},"image":["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/08/dining/ld-church-cake/ld-church-cake-mediumSquareAt3X.jpg","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/08/dining/ld-church-cake/ld-church-cake-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/08/dining/ld-church-cake/ld-church-cake-superJumbo.jpg"],"totalTime":"PT1H","recipeYield":"One 9-inch layer cake","recipeCuisine":"southern","recipeCategory":"dessert","keywords":"buttermilk, cocoa powder, heavy cream, layer cake, unsweetened chocolate, easter","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":4,"ratingCount":1787},"recipeIngredient":["1 1/2 cups/350 grams granulated sugar","1 1/2 cups/325 grams heavy cream","8 ounces/225 grams unsweetened chocolate","6 ounces/170 grams unsalted butter","1 teaspoon vanilla paste or extract","Nonstick cooking spray","1 cup/120 grams unsweetened cocoa powder, dark (Dutch-processed) if available, plus more for pans","3 1/2 cups/700 grams granulated sugar","2 3/4 cups/365 grams all-purpose flour (see Tip)","2 teaspoons baking powder","2 teaspoons baking soda","1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt","3 large eggs, beaten","1 1/2 cups/350 grams buttermilk, preferably cultured whole buttermilk","3/4 cup/145 grams canola or other neutral oil","2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"HowToStep","text":"Make the frosting: In a large saucepan, bring sugar and cream to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally.

You can refrigerate the cake in between frosting each layer to ensure that your frosting is set and firm so that your next layer will be propped up properly. If the frosting is too soft, the next layer will just flatten the filling. Frost the outside of the cake with the remaining frosting, letting it chill as you go if needed. Use an offset spatula or butter knife dipped in hot water and wiped clean to smooth and shine the finished cake. This cake keeps and is best served at room temperature for up to 2 days.

My daughter even commented on how it looked like a cake from a local bakery! A few notes, my frosting was definitely thin, I added about a half cup of heavy cream, a little confectionery sugar and used a hand beater. I frosted most of it, chilled the cake and the remaining frosting  I made and iced the rest of it afterwards. Next time I’ll chill the frosting after it reaches room temp. I used hot coffee as well in the batter."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"CG14"},"reviewBody":"This cake was amazing! I only have 8 inch pans, but 2/3 of the recipe into 2 pans made for a tall 2 layer cake, so I will likely split it into 3 8 inch pans next time, and just bake for less time. The frosting was rich and delicious. I did orange marmalade in between the layers with the chocolate frosting, and my family loved it! Thanks you Ms. Donovan for the new family favorite chocolate cake!"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sharona"},"reviewBody":"Although my frosting didn't look anything like this cake both in texture and color, I am still receiving calls 3 days later from people telling me how much they liked it.

I did have to use a hand mixer on the frosting and beat instead of the gentle whisking that the recipe called for.  I used hot coffee instead of hot water when I made the cake.  Kept beautifully for over 10 days in the refrigerator."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tony"},"reviewBody":"Came out great! More like a “blackout” cake than I was expecting though. The frosting ended up darker than the photo, more closely matching the color of the cake itself, so maybe reducing the chocolate would give it more contrast.\n\nCake was very moist, almost too much so.

Nobody eats this kind of cake, or probably any cake, every day.  Bringing up health concerns every time there's a recipe for something sweet is pretentious.

I participate in a wild game cooking FB group with a few simple rules. The most important rule is you never criticize what someone else eats.  Everyone is different.  Some want a cake with all the sugar and all the butter. It's cake! There is nothing inherently wrong with that.  If it appeals to you, make it and tell us how it was.  If it doesn't, just move on to something else.  Why shame others for liking what they like?  Me?

Bake them, cool completely (out of the pan) and refrigerate wrapped in plastic.

I’ve lived in the south my entire life and never heard anyone describe any cake as a church cake, but where I grew up in Eastern NC, ladies did compete to see how many layers tall they could bake cakes for funeral wakes and church homecomings.  Very thin yellow layers and a fudgy cooked icing.

It is a wonderful recipe, I’ve used it for frosting or fudge sauce since the middle ‘80’s, nothing else. But please NYT, don’t rip it off without giving credit to the Frog Commissary.

Wonderfully fudgy cake with intense luscious icing. Due to kitchen turmoil, I made the three layers the day before assembly and cooled them overnight on wire racks.

The icing is just barely enough so plan to use something else in between the layers or else be sparing in the use of it for the between layers.

Because of this — and because layer cakes may be as close as some will ever get to a holy experience — they’re often called church cakes. This chocolate one is a perfectly moist and stacked rendition of a pudding cake, with just the right amount of richness from the frosting. This formula needs no alterations, but there’s no sense in breaking the tradition of Southern bakers, who personalize recipes as a point of pride. Add pulverized praline to the center, or cinnamon or instant-coffee granules to the batter. Don’t be afraid to make it your own.

medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 minutes. Meanwhile, chop chocolate and cube butter. After the sugar mixture has simmered for 6 minutes, turn the heat off and add chocolate and butter to the saucepan. Stir until everything is melted. Stir in the vanilla. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature while you make the cake. Do not stir until it has cooled almost entirely, likely for as long as it will take you to mix and bake the cake.</p></div></li><li class="preparation_step__nzZHP"><div class="pantry--ui-lg-strong preparation_stepNumber__qWIz4">Step <!-- -->2</div><div class="preparation_stepContent__CFrQM"><p class="pantry--body-long">Make the cake: Heat oven to 325 degrees. Coat three 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray. Cut three rounds of parchment paper to fit the bottom of each pan and line each pan with one. Spray the parchment. Sprinkle the pans with cocoa powder to coat, tapping each pan over the sink or trash can to shake loose any excess.</p></div></li><li class="preparation_step__nzZHP"><div class="pantry--ui-lg-strong preparation_stepNumber__qWIz4">Step <!-- -->3</div><div class="preparation_stepContent__CFrQM"><p class="pantry--body-long">Meanwhile, in a very large bowl, whisk the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

Each pan should hold about 700 grams of batter. (Weighing your batter ensures even cooking and beautiful cake building.)

Set the pans on a wire rack to cool.</p></div></li><li class="preparation_step__nzZHP"><div class="pantry--ui-lg-strong preparation_stepNumber__qWIz4">Step <!-- -->6</div><div class="preparation_stepContent__CFrQM"><p class="pantry--body-long">When cakes are cooled, revisit your frosting, whisking to thicken and making sure not to overbeat or add any air or fluff to the frosting. Turn the cakes out of their pans and discard the parchment. Trim any rounded top off of each as evenly as possible.</p></div></li><li class="preparation_step__nzZHP"><div class="pantry--ui-lg-strong preparation_stepNumber__qWIz4">Step <!-- -->7</div><div class="preparation_stepContent__CFrQM"><p class="pantry--body-long">Assemble the cake: Scoop about ¾ cup of frosting on one layer set on a cake plate, then repeat with the second and third layers. You can refrigerate the cake in between frosting each layer to ensure that your frosting is set and firm so that your next layer will be propped up properly. If the frosting is too soft, the next layer will just flatten the filling. Frost the outside of the cake with the remaining frosting, letting it chill as you go if needed. Use an offset spatula or butter knife dipped in hot water and wiped clean to smooth and shine the finished cake. This cake keeps and is best served at room temperature for up to 2 days. It holds remarkably well in the refrigerator for up to one week and can be served cold.</p></div></li></ol></div><div class="tips_tips__Fa_AO"><span class="pantry--label">Tip</span><ul

no health concerns.  Nobody eats this kind of cake, or probably any cake, every day.  Bringing up health concerns every time there's a recipe for something sweet is pretentious.  Every doctor I've ever been to has advised "all things in moderation" and that goes for cake as well.  If one doesn't like cake then eat pie.  In moderation.  Unlike your remote, life doesn't come with a rerun button.  Enjoy it.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"> 737</span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">William Wroblicka</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">1 year ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">Note to the food police: You can't arbitrarily reduce the amount of sugar in a cake recipe without adversely affecting flavor and texture. This is a "high ratio" cake in which the amount of sugar exceeds the amount of flour. The sugar's needed to offset the bitterness of the cocoa, which gives the cake its rich chocolate flavor.

I participate in a wild game cooking FB group with a few simple rules. The most important rule is you never criticize what someone else eats.  Everyone is different.  Some want a cake with all the sugar and all the butter. It's cake! There is nothing inherently wrong with that.  If it appeals to you, make it and tell us how it was.  If it doesn't, just move on to something else.  Why shame others for liking what they like?  Me?  I'm making the cake</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"> 322</span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Scott</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">1 year ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">My mother never baked cake for me; there wasn't time with our family business.

Lisa Donovan’s recipes are so full of love they make me weep with pleasure in the knowledge I am so well cared for.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"> 115</span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">PF</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">1 year ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">Back in the days when I had reasons to bake cakes, I found that baking the layers in advance led to the best results. Bake them, cool completely (out of the pan) and refrigerate wrapped in plastic. You get one messy process out of the way (and cleaned up!) plus ensuring the layers are fully cooled and ready to frost.

I never had the knack for making it, but I’d crash a stranger’s wake or a homecoming at a chute didn’t know for a slice of that cake!</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"> 71</span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Anne</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">1 year ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">This frosting recipe is EXACTLY like the one in the Frog Commissary Cookbook from Philadelphia except for the last sentence of the directions.

Also I highly recommend the cookbook if you can get your hands on one as I think it might be out of print.

Wonderfully fudgy cake with intense luscious icing. Due to kitchen turmoil, I made the three layers the day before assembly and cooled them overnight on wire racks.

My daughter even commented on how it looked like a cake from a local bakery! A few notes, my frosting was definitely thin, I added about a half cup of heavy cream, a little confectionery sugar and used a hand beater. I frosted most of it, chilled the cake and the remaining frosting  I made and iced the rest of it afterwards. Next time I’ll chill the frosting after it reaches room temp. I used hot coffee as well in the batter.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"></span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">CG14</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">4 months ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">This cake was amazing!

It looks even darker than the pic and tasted FABULOUS!!!!!</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"></span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Catherine</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">5 months ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">Baking time was quite a bit longer than indicated.

It worked very well, and turned out splendidly!</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"></span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Dinah</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">5 months ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">My icing was darker than the icing in the picture, but still tasted great!

It holds remarkably well in the refrigerator for up to one week and can be served cold."}],"isAccessibleForFree":"False","hasPart":{"@type":"WebPageElement","isAccessibleForFree":"False","cssSelector":".recipe"},"publisher":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Organization","name":"NYT Cooking","url":"https://cooking.nytimes.com","alternateName":["nytimes cooking","New York Times Cooking"],"image":[{"url":"https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/f66a631/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg","height":31,"width":168,"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"ImageObject"},{"url":"https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/f66a631/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg","height":24,"width":131,"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"ImageObject"}],"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/","https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/","https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/","https://twitter.com/nytfood","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]},"review":[{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sara Parks"},"reviewBody":"The most delicious cake- huge!
